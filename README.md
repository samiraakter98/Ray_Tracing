# Ray_Tracing
This repository contains my implementation of a ray tracing renderer, developed as part of a computer graphics course assignment. Ray tracing is a powerful rendering technique that simulates the physical behavior of light to create highly realistic images.

Basic ray tracing algorithm implementation
Support for multiple geometric primitives (spheres, planes, etc.)
Phong illumination model for realistic shading
Reflection and refraction effects
Soft shadows using area light sources
Anti-aliasing for smoother edges
